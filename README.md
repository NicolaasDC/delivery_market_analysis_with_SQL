## The Mission

> We are a small start-up interested in creating a web app that compares prices and different services provided by food delivery apps in Belgium. To that end, we have hired your team to analyze databases provided by a consultant to uncover actionable insights for restaurant partners and consumers.  Our tech stack uses SQL and Python which your solution must use as well. Finally, you must present your intial findings in a week as we will meet with investors in the following week.

The objective is to explore trends, customer preferences, and market dynamics in the food delivery space. Conduct exploratory analysis, summarize findings, and present actionable insights.
